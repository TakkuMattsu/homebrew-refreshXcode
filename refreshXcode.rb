require "formula"

# This is a non-functional example formula to showcase all features and
# therefore, it's overly complex and dupes stuff just to comment on it.
# You may want to use `brew create` to start your own new formula!
# Documentation: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Formula-Cookbook.md

## Naming -- Every Homebrew formula is a class of the type `Formula`.
# Ruby classes have to start Upper case and dashes are not allowed.
# So we transform: `example-formula.rb` into `ExampleFormula`. Further,
# Homebrew does enforce that the name of the file and the class correspond.
# Check with `brew search` that the name is free.

  # For integrity and security, we verify the hash (`openssl dgst -sha1 <FILE>`)
  # You may also use sha256 if the software uses sha256 on their homepage.
  # Leave it empty at first and `brew install` will tell you the expected.
